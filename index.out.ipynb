    "## Other software\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledge organization systems are also managed by other types software [excluded from this report](#scope).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generic software\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple terminologies can be managed in a **spreadsheet** (LibreOffice Calc, Excel, Google Sheets…). This software lacks most special functionality for terminology management but the usability and accessibility is very high. Some tools in the list above (VocExcel, voc4cat-tool) enhance standard spreadsheets with terminology management functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same applies to **database management systems** (RDBMS, NoSQL, RDF triple stores, property graph databases…) with some additional features such as unique key constraints but less usability. An edge case might be systems for management of knowledge graphs (such as Wikibase), included above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools for personal **knowledge management** (such as [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [Notion](https://www.notion.com/)) help to structure ideas and concepts. Similar tools exist for enterprises to support data integration, knowledge management and/or business intelligence of an organization (for instance [PoolParty Semantic Suite](https://www.poolparty.biz/product-overview)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Several **Content Management Systems** (CMS) allow to manage a list or hierarchy of topics or other entities for knowledge managements. If these lists can be exported, the CMS can be applied to manage terminologies. An example is [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/), which was used for the first version of BARTOC terminology registry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Terminologies can also directly be managed in **files** for instance in RDF/Turtle syntax. This only requires a text editor but the risk is high to introduce errors. A version control system such as git can be used on top to track changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hosted services\n",
    "\n",
    "Some organizations host their own applications for KOS management. Examples from cultural heritage domain in Germany are [DANTE](https://doi.org/10.11588/akmb.2018.1.63475) and [xTree](https://xtree-public.digicult-verbund.de/). The BARTOC [list of terminology registries](https://bartoc.org/registries) includes some more terminology services that may also include management functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminology management\n",
    "\n",
    "The term “terminology management” is also used for systems to organize the terms, definitions, and translations used in an organization. See Montoro ([2018](#ref-Montoro2018)) for a list of terminology management systems. The focus of these systems is more on translation but there is some overlap with KOS management.\n",
