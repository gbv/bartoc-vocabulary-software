    "\n",
    "### More generic software\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple terminologies can be managed in a **spreadsheet** (LibreOffice Calc, Excel, Google Sheets…). This software lacks most special functionality for terminology management but the usability and accessibility is very high. Some tools in the list above (VocExcel, voc4cat-tool) enhance standard spreadsheets with terminology management functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same applies to **database management systems** (RDBMS, NoSQL, RDF triple stores, property graph databases…) with some additional features such as unique key constraints but less usability. An edge case might be systems for management of knowledge graphs (such as Wikibase), included above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools for personal **knowledge management** (such as [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [Notion](https://www.notion.com/)) help to structure ideas and concepts. Similar tools exist for enterprises to support data integration, knowledge management and/or business intelligence of an organization (for instance [PoolParty Semantic Suite](https://www.poolparty.biz/product-overview)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Several **Content Management Systems** (CMS) allow to manage a list or hierarchy of topics or other entities for knowledge managements. If these lists can be exported, the CMS can be applied to manage terminologies. An example is [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/), which was used for the first version of BARTOC terminology registry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Terminologies can also directly be managed in **files** for instance in RDF/Turtle syntax. This only requires a **text editor** but the risk is high to introduce errors. A **version control system** such as git can be used on top to track changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### More specific software\n",
    "\n",
    "The term **terminology management** is also used for systems to organize the terms, definitions, and translations used in an organization. See Montoro ([2018](#ref-Montoro2018)) for a list of terminology management systems. The focus of these systems is more on translation but there is some overlap with KOS management. Software aimed at simple lists of terms, definitions, glossaries and similar is also excluded from this report.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several systems and applications exist to manage identifiers (Domain Name System, [w3id](https://w3id.org/)…). These **identifier systems** are relevant to manage KOS but they are rarely enough for KOS management alone. See [Bioregistry](https://bioregistry.io/) for a registry of identifier systems used with KOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several tools, frameworks and programming languages exist for **data transformation** between different formats and/or models ([XSLT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT), [jq](https://jqlang.org/), [Catmandu](https://librecat.org/), [DTL](https://getdtl.org/), [LinkML-map](https://linkml.io/linkml-map/), [QVT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QVT)…). These transformations often imply or make use of terminology mappings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tools for **data curation** also make use of or require terminologies, for instance [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) and [mix’n’match](https://mix-n-match.toolforge.org/). The latter comes close to a mapping editor but it is limited to mappings with Wikidata.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limited use\n",
    "\n",
    "Some organizations run **hosted services** for KOS management or related services. Examples include [DANTE](https://doi.org/10.11588/akmb.2018.1.63475), [xTree](https://xtree-public.digicult-verbund.de/) and [Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV)](http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/). More examples may be found in the BARTOC [list of terminology registries](https://bartoc.org/registries).\n",
    "\n",
    "**programming libraries** such as [cocoda-sdk](https://github.com/gbv/cocoda-sdk/), [TSS Widgets](https://github.com/ts4nfdi/terminology-service-suite), [jskos-vue](https://github.com/gbv/jskos-vue/), [SeMRA](https://semra.readthedocs.io/), and [ng-skos](http://gbv.github.io/ng-skos/) are used to build KOS software.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other software\n",
    "\n",
    "The following do not fit into the software categories above or there was not enough information:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   [Scripts to analyze concept drift](https://github.com/Multilingual-LGBTQIA-Vocabularies/Examing_LGBTQ_Concepts) as part of a research project (Open Source)\n",
    "-   [TopBraid EDG](https://www.topquadrant.com/topbraid-edg/) is a commercial knowledge graph editor\n",
    "-   [Apelon DTS](https://www.apelondts.org/) (Distributed Terminology System) and Apelon TermManager are commercial terminology editors. An earlier [version from 2013](https://apelon-dts.sourceforge.net/) is available as Open Source.\n",
    "-   [Grafo](https://gra.fo/) is a collaborative knowledge graph editor, available as commercial web application\n",
    "-   [Vitro](https://github.com/vivo-project/Vitro) is a framework for semantic web applications, used in [VIVO](https://vivoweb.org/)\n",
