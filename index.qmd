The terminology registry **[BARTOC](https://bartoc.org/)** collects information about all kinds of **knowledge organization systems** (KOS) such as controlled vocabularies, classifications, ontologies, and other semantic artifacts. This report summarizes information about software for KOS management.

## Scope

This report is limited to [software specialized](#specialized-software) for editing, vizualizing and/or analyzing terminologies.^[The term "terminology" in this document is used as synonym for all kinds of knowledge organization systems.] Software excluded if:

- it only happens to make use of terminologies (for instance OpenRefine), or
- it only contains a minor terminology management module (for instance [content management systems], or
- it can only be used as [hosted service](#hosted-services) (for instance DANTE), or
- the type of terminologies managed with the software is limited to glossaries and simple lists of terms.

This also excludes the established category of software known as "[terminology management]" to manage a centralized repository of approved terms, definitions, and translations in an organization. Related KOS software is partly [listed or referenced below](#related-software).

The terminology software is listed [in a JSON file](kos-software.json) as array of flat records with the following fields:

Field | Purpose
------|--------
`name` | Name of the software
`url` | Homepage
`platform` | Operating System or similar dependency (Web application, CLI...) 
`api` | whether a web service or similar API is provided to connect to
`edit` | whether vocabularies can be modified with the software
`language` | programming language(s) of the software
`license` | license of the software
`repository` | Source Code repository
`update` | year of most recent update of the software

## Specialized Software

```{python}
#| label: tbl-software
from IPython.display import Markdown
from tabulate import tabulate
import pandas as pd
from urllib.parse import urlparse
from IPython.display import display, HTML
import re

def hyperlink(row):
    if pd.notna(row['url']):
        return f'<a href="{row["url"]}">{row["name"]}</a>'
    else:
        return row['name']    

def cell(value):
    if isinstance(value, bool):
        return "✓" if value else "-"
    elif type(value) is str and re.match(r"^https?://",value):
        url = urlparse(value)
        host = url.hostname.split(".")[-2]
        return f'<a href="{value}">{host}</a>'
    elif pd.notna(value):
        return value
    return ""

df = pd.read_json('kos-software.json')

df["name"] = df.apply(hyperlink, axis=1)
df = df.drop(columns=["url"])
df = df.applymap(cell)
display(HTML(df.to_html(escape=False,index=False)))
```

## Related software

The following software products support editing, viewing and/or analyzing controlled vocabularies but not as a core feature. They might be used for controlled vocabularies as well.

### Generic software

Simple terminologies can be managed in a spreadsheet (LibreOffice Calc, Excel, Google Sheets...). This software lacks most special functionality for terminology management but the usability and accesibility is very high.

The same applies to database management systems with some additional features such as unique key constraints but less usability.

Terminologies can also be managed in files for instance in RDF/Turtle syntax. This only requires a text editor but the risk is high to introduce errors.

### Content Management Systems

Several Content Management Systems (CMS) allow to manage a list or hierarchy of topics or other entities for knowledge managements. If these lists can be exported, the CMS can be applied to manage terminologies. An example is Drupal, which was used for the first version of BARTOC terminology registry.
