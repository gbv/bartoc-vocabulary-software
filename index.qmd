The terminology registry **[BARTOC](https://bartoc.org/)** collects information about all kinds of **knowledge organization systems** (KOS) such as controlled vocabularies, classifications, ontologies, and other semantic artifacts. This report summarizes information about [software for KOS management](#kos-software).

## Scope

This report is limited to **[specialized KOS software](#kos-software) for editing, vizualizing and/or analyzing terminologies.** The term "terminology" in this document is used as synonym for all kinds of KOS. Software is excluded if:

- it only happens to make use of terminologies (for instance [OpenRefine]), or
- it is more [generic software] that can be used for terminology management among other use cases (like database management systems), or
- it can only be used as [hosted service](#hosted-services), or
- it is a programming library ([jskos-vue], [cocoda-sdk], [TSS Widgets]...), or
- it is limited to simple lists of terms, glossaries and similar, or
- it is so called [terminology management] software for a a centralized repository of approved terms, definitions, and translations in an organization.

## KOS Software

```{python}
#| label: tbl-software
from IPython.display import Markdown
from tabulate import tabulate
import pandas as pd
from urllib.parse import urlparse
from IPython.display import display, HTML
import re

def hyperlink(row):
    if pd.notna(row['url']):
        return f'<a href="{row["url"]}">{row["name"]}</a>'
    else:
        return row['name']    

def cell(value):
    if isinstance(value, bool):
        return "✓" if value else "-"
    elif type(value) is str and re.match(r"^https?://",value):
        url = urlparse(value)
        host = url.hostname.split(".")[-2]
        return f'<a href="{value}">{host}</a>'
    elif not pd.notna(value):
        return ""
    elif type(value) is float: # pd converts string to float
        return int(value)
    return value

df = pd.read_json('kos-software.json')

df["name"] = df.apply(hyperlink, axis=1)
df = df.sort_values(by=["update"],ascending=False)
df = df.drop(columns=["url"])
df = df.applymap(cell)
display(HTML(df.to_html(escape=False,index=False)))
```

The list of software is managed [in a JSON file](kos-software.json) as array of records with flat fields as [described below](#metadata). Applications without license or repository are close source. Deprecated applications are included for historical reference.

## Metadata

Field | Purpose
------|--------
`name` | name
`url` | homepage
`platform` | operating system or similar dependency (Web, CLI...) 
`api` | whether a web service or similar API is provided to connect to
`edit` | whether vocabularies can be modified with the software
`language` | programming language(s)
`license` | license of the software (if free software)
`repository` | source Code repository (if open source)
`update` | year of most recent update
`category` | type of software

: {tbl-colwidths="[25,75]"}

The KOS software categories are preliminary:

- viewer
- editor
- mapping editor
- converter
- validator
- database

## Other software

### Generic software

Simple terminologies can be managed in a **spreadsheet** (LibreOffice Calc, Excel, Google Sheets...). This software lacks most special functionality for terminology management but the usability and accessibility is very high. Some tools in the list above (VocExcel, voc4cat-tool) enhance standard spreadsheets with terminology management functionalities.

The same applies to **database management systems** (RDBMS, NoSQL, RDF triple stores, property graph databases...) with some additional features such as unique key constraints but less usability. An edge case might be systems for management of knowledge graphs (such as Wikibase), included above.

Tools for personal **knowledge management** (such as [Obsidian] and [Notion]) help to structure ideas and concepts. Similar tools exist for enterprises to support data integration, knowledge management and/or business intelligence of an organization (for instance [PoolParty Semantic Suite]).

Several **Content Management Systems** (CMS) allow to manage a list or hierarchy of topics or other entities for knowledge managements. If these lists can be exported, the CMS can be applied to manage terminologies. An example is [Drupal], which was used for the first version of BARTOC terminology registry.

Terminologies can also directly be managed in **files** for instance in RDF/Turtle syntax. This only requires a text editor but the risk is high to introduce errors. A version control system such as git can be used on top to track changes.

### Hosted services

Some organizations host applications for KOS management (the list is likely incomplete):

- [DANTE](https://doi.org/10.11588/akmb.2018.1.63475)
- [xTree](https://xtree-public.digicult-verbund.de/)
- ...
