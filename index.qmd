The terminology registry **[BARTOC](https://bartoc.org/)** collects information about all kinds of **knowledge organization systems** (KOS) such as controlled vocabularies, classifications, ontologies, and other semantic artifacts. This report summarizes information about [software for KOS management](#specialized-software).

## Scope

This report is limited to **[software specialized](#specialized-software) for editing, vizualizing and/or analyzing terminologies.** The term "terminology" in this document is used as synonym for all kinds of KOS. Software is excluded if:

- it only happens to make use of terminologies (for instance OpenRefine), or
- it is more [generic software] that can be used for terminology management among other use cases (like database management systems), or
- it can only be used as [hosted service](#hosted-services) (for instance DANTE), or
- the type of terminologies managed with the software is limited to simple lists of terms, glossaries or similar.

The latter also excludes the established category of software known as "[terminology management]" to manage a centralized repository of approved terms, definitions, and translations in an organization: such software is partly [listed or referenced below](#other-software).

## Specialized Software

Deprecated applications are included for historical reference.

```{python}
#| label: tbl-software
from IPython.display import Markdown
from tabulate import tabulate
import pandas as pd
from urllib.parse import urlparse
from IPython.display import display, HTML
import re

def hyperlink(row):
    if pd.notna(row['url']):
        return f'<a href="{row["url"]}">{row["name"]}</a>'
    else:
        return row['name']    

def cell(value):
    if isinstance(value, bool):
        return "✓" if value else "-"
    elif type(value) is str and re.match(r"^https?://",value):
        url = urlparse(value)
        host = url.hostname.split(".")[-2]
        return f'<a href="{value}">{host}</a>'
    elif not pd.notna(value):
        return ""
    elif type(value) is float: # pd converts string to float
        return int(value)
    return value

df = pd.read_json('kos-software.json')

df["name"] = df.apply(hyperlink, axis=1)
df = df.sort_values(by=["update"],ascending=False)
df = df.drop(columns=["url"])
df = df.applymap(cell)
display(HTML(df.to_html(escape=False,index=False)))
```

The following applications, scripts, and/or libraries may also worth to consider for KOS management but they have not been evaluated yet enough to be included in the list above:

- SSSOM (Python)
- TS4NFDI API Gateway
- TS4NFDI Widgets
- [Scripts to analyze concept drift](https://github.com/Multilingual-LGBTQIA-Vocabularies/Examing_LGBTQ_Concepts)

## Data

The terminology software is listed [in a JSON file](kos-software.json) as array of flat records with the following fields:

Field | Purpose
------|--------
`name` | Name of the software
`url` | Homepage
`platform` | Operating System or similar dependency (Web application, CLI...) 
`api` | whether a web service or similar API is provided to connect to
`edit` | whether vocabularies can be modified with the software
`language` | programming language(s) of the software
`license` | license of the software
`repository` | Source Code repository
`update` | year of most recent update of the software
`category` | type of software

: {tbl-colwidths="[25,75]"}


## Other software

The following software products support editing, viewing and/or analyzing controlled vocabularies but not as a core feature. They might be used for controlled vocabularies as well.

| Name & URL | OS | edit | api | language | license | repository | update |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| [Aristotle Metadata Registry](http://aristotlemetadata.com/) | Web | yes | yes | Python/Django | Closed Source | [Github](https://github.com/Aristotle-Metadata-Enterprises/) | 2025 
| [PoolParty Semantic Suite](https://www.poolparty.biz/product-overview) | ? | yes | ? | ? | Closed Source | - | 
| [excel2rdf](https://github.com/edmondchuc/excel2rdf) | - | yes | no | Python | GPL | [GitHub](https://github.com/edmondchuc/excel2rdf) | 2021
| [TopBraid Composer](https://allegrograph.com/topbraid-composer/) | ? | yes | ? | ? | - | - | 

### Generic software

Simple terminologies can be managed in a **spreadsheet** (LibreOffice Calc, Excel, Google Sheets...). This software lacks most special functionality for terminology management but the usability and accessibility is very high. Some tools in the list below enhance standard spreadsheets with terminology management functionalities (e.g. vocexcel, voc4cat-tool).

The same applies to **database management systems** (RDBMS, NoSQL, RDF triple stores, property graph databases...) with some additional features such as unique key constraints but less usability. An edge case might be systems for management of knowledge graphs (such as Semantic MediaWiki and Wikibase, [included above](#software)), and for personal knowledge management (such as Obsidian and Notion, not included above).

Several **Content Management Systems** (CMS) allow to manage a list or hierarchy of topics or other entities for knowledge managements. If these lists can be exported, the CMS can be applied to manage terminologies. An example is Drupal, which was used for the first version of BARTOC terminology registry.

<!--
More examples:

- [Sanity Taxonomy Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sanity-plugin-taxonomy-manager) (for Sanity CMS)
-->

Terminologies can also directly be managed in **files** for instance in RDF/Turtle syntax. This only requires a text editor but the risk is high to introduce errors.

### Hosted services

Some organizations host applications for KOS management (the list is likely incomplete):

- [DANTE](https://doi.org/10.11588/akmb.2018.1.63475)
- [xTree](https://xtree-public.digicult-verbund.de/)
- ...
